# To predict the Titanic Passenger Survival with Supervised Machine Learning Model
                
 Goal: To build a Machine Learning Model that predicts if the passenger if Titanic has survived or not
 
 Steps:
 
  1. The data was given.
  2. EDA was done
  3. Split the data into train and test sets
  4. Feature engineering 
  5. Model building and training the dataset
  6. Cross validation
  7. Hyperparameter tuning
  8. Testing the data
